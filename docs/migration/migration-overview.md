# Migration Overview

## Executive Summary

This migration project aims to rebuild the current portfolio site (https://cstannahill-software-dev.vercel.app/en) from the ground up with a more maintainable technology stack. The current portfolio is built on the Once UI template (https://github.com/once-ui-system/magic-portfolio), which creates conflicts with Tailwind CSS for responsive design and has proven difficult to maintain and expand. The rebuilt portfolio will maintain the same visual design and content while significantly improving mobile responsiveness and future maintainability.

## Goals

- Recreate the existing portfolio design and functionality using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS
- Resolve mobile responsiveness issues present in the current implementation
- Maintain high SEO, accessibility, and performance scores (currently mid to upper 90's)
- Establish a more maintainable codebase for future content and feature additions
- Eliminate the dependency on Once UI which conflicts with Tailwind's responsive utilities
- Preserve all current content, projects, and features during the migration

## Current Issues

- The Once UI system conflicts with Tailwind CSS for responsiveness
- Mobile experience is significantly worse than desktop (particularly the header and navigation)
- Considerable time spent (12+ hours) attempting to fix responsive issues without sustainable solutions
- Future additions and maintenance are hampered by complexities in the current system

## Technology Choices

- **Current Stack:** Next.js + Once UI template + Tailwind CSS (with conflicts)
- **Target Stack:** Next.js + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS (without Once UI)
- **Deployment:** Continue using Vercel for hosting

## High-Level Steps

1. Create a new repository/codespace with a clean Next.js + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui installation
2. Transfer documentation and planning artifacts to the new project
3. Document current design with screenshots and component mapping
4. Implement core layout components (header, footer, navigation) with mobile-first approach
5. Rebuild content components and pages with identical styling but improved responsiveness
6. Migrate content (projects, blog posts, about sections)
7. Test extensively on multiple devices and screen sizes
8. Deploy to staging environment for final validation
9. Switch primary domain to the new implementation
