## üß© Core Challenges

<ProjectChallengeCard
  title="Framework-Aware Code Translation"
  challenge="Traditional syntax-based converters fail to capture framework patterns like hooks, routing, or state stores."
  solution="Implemented a translation engine that factors in project context, package mappings, and user-intended logic using AI-backed parsing."
  impact="Boosted translation confidence, improved accuracy, and enabled smoother onboarding for learning paths."
  difficulty="high"
  domain="AI / Developer Tooling"
/>

<ProjectChallengeCard
  title="Personalized Curriculum Design"
  challenge="Generic courses often mismatch developer experience or learning style, resulting in low engagement."
  solution="Designed an adaptive engine that creates paths based on user's repo data, goals, and skill gaps."
  impact="Increased engagement, improved learning efficiency, and reduced drop-off."
  difficulty="medium"
  domain="Learning Systems"
/>
