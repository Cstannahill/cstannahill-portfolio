This platform is used to deeply inspect and visualize the evolution of software repositories. It reveals the quality, consistency, and maturity of codebases using modern AI techniques—all running locally or optionally enhanced with GPT/Claude APIs.

From team collaboration insights to anti-pattern detection and skill growth charts, Code Evolution Tracker is ideal for engineers, tech leads, and educators looking to surface hidden stories in source code.
